[Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) is a tool for fetching system information and displaying them in a pretty way. 
In this repo, I collect my config files that I designed for my [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) rice. 
Feel free to copy files and modify them or clone the complete repository.
